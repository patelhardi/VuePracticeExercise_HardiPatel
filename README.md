Problem J2: Epidemiology
Problem Description
  People who study epidemiology use models to analyze the spread of disease. In this problem, we
  use a simple model.
  When a person has a disease, they infect exactly R other people but only on the very next day. No
  person is infected more than once. We want to determine when a total of more than P people have
  had the disease.
